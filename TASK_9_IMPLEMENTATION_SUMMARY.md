- **DEBUG (10)**: General debugging information
- **INFO (20)**: General information messages
- **PERFORMANCE (25)**: Performance metrics and timing
- **WARNING (30)**: Warning messages
- **ERROR (40)**: Error messages
- **CRITICAL (50)**: Critical system errors
- **SECURITY (60)**: Security-related events

### Integration with Existing Components

#### Enhanced ImageConverter
